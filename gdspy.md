## Installation with conda

pip installation was working fine in my home computer but impossible to make it work at my workplace. It worked with conda.

* Install miniconda from here:

  *  https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html
  * I installed only for me and checked "Install in path"

* Launch anaconda powershell prompt

* Create an environment with conda and install gdspy package:

  ```
  conda create --name sci-env gdspy
  ```

* Activate the environment:

  ```
  conda activate sci-env
  ```
