Get the newest version here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/
Next will be done with WinPython_3.6
Launch the .exe (it is actually just an extraction, not a real installation)
	Select the folder. I chose "C:\PortApps\WinPython"
Register WinPython on the machine with path variables
	There are two path variables that need to be set:
		C:\PortApps\WinPython\python-3.6.5.amd64
		C:\PortApps\WinPython\python-3.6.5.amd64\Scripts
	Add environment variables into the path:
		Download rapidee (https://www.rapidee.com/en/download) zip file
		Extract rapidee
		Run rapidee.exe (right click → run as administrator)
		Add the two paths in the path variable:
			Right click on "Path=..." → add values
			Save the changes
Check your installation
	Open a command line of windows (for instance windows key + x → power shell)
	type python → you should be greeted by python console
Start coding
	Go to your WinPython directory and start Spyder.exe or Jupyter Notebook.exe
	
(I did not try) You can easily convert your portable WinPython installation into a standard one by simply running WinPython Control Panel.exe and choosing to register this version on your machine. Please note that there are dependencies (C++ Redistributables) needed for some packages. You can read more about that here: https://github.com/winpython/winpython/wiki/Installation

Install gdspy in WinPython
	get the pre-compiled binaries from here: https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy/releases
		in my case: "gdspy-1.2.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl"
		copy this file in the folder "C:\PortApps\WinPython\python-3.6.5.amd64\Scripts"
	in WinPython folder, start "WinPython Command Prompt.exe"
	> pip install gdspy-1.2.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
	Installation is done
